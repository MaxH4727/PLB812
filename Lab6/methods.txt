Lab 6 - TopGo - Methods

After re-running DESeq w/ the looser p-value constraints,downloaded GO Term annotation from phytozome and coppied in example R script. Wrote small script to fix gene IDs and ensure they align.

Made two gene lists by calling for Log2FoldChanges above and below one, then ran TopGo for all three lists for both the up and down regulated genes.

Wrote output tables to CSVs, cloned github directory to local drive on laptop, moved appropriate/edited files from the last two labs, pushed.

Wrote methods and pushed.
