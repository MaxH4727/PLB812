PLB 812 Assignment 3: Trimming

Installed trimmomatic to my PLB812 condaa enviroment for easier pathing to the proper Illumina adapter indexes.

Took old loop script from assignment two, changed the working directory to operate only within my raw fastq directory, and assigned the ERR number for each of my 6 paired-end read sets to a list.

For each variable in that list, used a loop to call trimmomatic, and used {variable}<_1/_2> to differentiate between the sets of paired reads when providing them to trimmoamatic and for setting the output file names.

Designed 6 threads for each pair, adapter sequences from conda env directory,and a sliding window and min length.

Called fastqc on any resulting output files.

Moved output_qc files manually to /Lab3. In future, will work to code this step into the script.

Major challenge encountered was an issue with the adapter input because I initially failed to designate what I think were parameters to read those fasta files after the path. After designating the standard values from the documentation, the script worked.

Also encoutered brief formatting challenge. Due to the long strucutre of the trimmomatic command, for easy viewing and editing, I wanted to break the argument into multiple lines, but initially did so with backwards slashes insteads or forward, leading to interpretation of the new lines as new commands. Easy correction.
