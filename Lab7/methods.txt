Lab 7 - BWA Alignment - Methods

Already had arabidopsis genome downloaded. Used SRA prefetch o download dataset and fastq dump to convert.

Called fastqc to check quality of reads before trimming. Used trimmomattic with LEADING:25 and TRAILING:25 arguments to trim read ends below a 25 phred score. 

Re-called fastqc and placed files and htmls of pre and post qcs into seperate directories

Created new conda enviroment into which installed BWA and Samtools

Used script to create BWA index from Arabidopsis genome before the actual alignment. Piped the alignment output into samtools for BAM file conversion. 

Finally, used samtools flagstat for final file generation.
