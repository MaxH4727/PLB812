1. Fastqc

After downloading the full contingent of SRA files needed, I continued running into problems with some of them being "truncated" and aborting midway through fastqc analysis. I determined this was likely casued by an interuption during their fastq-dump after a series of wipes and attempted re-doing on the process from prefetch. 

While a hassle, the repeated expeiance got me very familair with the process, and frustrated enough that by the end of it, I have now written a script than puts together every step from prefetch to fastqc, which worked, and heavily draws upon the basic loop example script provided.

The script is titled rnfast_qc.sh, and is contained in my Lab2 folder along with this methods document.
